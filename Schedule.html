  <p>Our Daily Routine/ Schedule are posted in each playroom for parents’ information. Each group follows a scheduled daily opportunities for outdoor and indoor play and activities appropriate to their age and developmental needs.</p>
  <p>Basic routines like washing hands, meal times and nap/rest times are kept to be consistent and predictable to help children understand their environment and feel secure. Time schedule or duration of each activity is flexible and adjusted based on the age and developmental needs and interests of the children, special activities (off site activities/ field trips) and weather. A balance of quiet and active times are planned to help children learn how to pace themselves. Schedule is also planned that balances whole-group activities, small group interaction, alone time and child-directed open play to foster the importance of community, value of friendship and respect of individual needs.</p>
